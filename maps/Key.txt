--First Line--

The first line of a map file has the following format.

[MAP]::[ID]::[Name]

MAP     a three letter code to let you know it's a MAP file. We might not need this.
ID      a unique number that we give to a map.
Name    believe it or not, the name of the map.

I want to use an ID as the index because I want to be able to change the map's friendly name 
without having to worry about changing any code.


--Key--

# = A plain wall
S = The start position when you first load into a level
@ = Some kind of save/healing shrine/well/thing
C = A chest!
